# Time-series Wheather - forcasting
using lstm time series forcasting
## Dataset
### In this project, i need to do weather forecasting using time series.i use Keras and Recurrent Neural Network(RNN). Predict the temperature column ‘ _tempm’ for Delhi, using Time Series Forecasting
## Steps:
### 1.clean the data 2.remove nan value 3.seperate the features and labels 4.scaling
## Model
### Conclusion A long short-term memory network (LSTM) is one of the most commonly used neural networks for time series analysis. The ability of LSTM to remember previous information makes it ideal for such tasks.
